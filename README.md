This notebook was created for Reverie Books to help streamline the wrangling of data to make book order decisions each week. It also does some cleaning on the book categories, though there is more cleaning to be done. 
Uses 3 spreadsheets exported from Square and outputs one spreadsheet with the necessary data grouped for convenience.
